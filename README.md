## Changelog

### Unpublished changes from 0.3.0 to `master`

* Add `--tls-client-crt-file` and `--tls-client-rsa-key-file` options to the example `mqttc`. Thanks to [marcelbuesing](https://github.com/marcelbuesing) for the PR!
* Remove `ClientBuilder.set_connection_mode`, which was unused. Thanks to [marcelbuesing](https://github.com/marcelbuesing) for the PR! 

### 0.3.0

* Add WebSocket support under Cargo feature "websocket".
* Switch `ClientBuilder` to use a URL instead of host and port. This was a breaking change to make it simple for consumers to switch protocol.

Thanks to [JarredAllen](https://github.com/JarredAllen) for the implementation!

### 0.2.0

* Update `tokio` dependency to v1.2.0. Thanks to [marcelbuesing](https://github.com/marcelbuesing) for the PR!

### 0.1.7

* Implement `Debug` for `Client` and `ClientOptions`
* Reduce dependencies for faster and less fiddly builds: `env_logger`
  and `structopt` are now dev-dependencies, `rustls` is now optional but
  included by default as part of the `tls` feature.

Thanks to [marcelbuesing](https://github.com/marcelbuesing) for the PRs!

### 0.1.6

* `Client` is `Send`.

### 0.1.5

* Correctly connect only once when automatic_connect is disabled.

### 0.1.4

* Missing ping responses should cause a disconnect even when keepalive > op timeout.

* Publish with retain flag.

### 0.1.3

* Added timeouts to disconnect, and publish when QoS=0.

### 0.1.2

* Enable automatic reconnects by default.

* This tracks subscriptions and replays them after reconnecting. No publish retries yet.
